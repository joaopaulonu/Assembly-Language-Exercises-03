# Assembly-Language-Exercises-03
This project contains a series of 2 practical Assembly language exercises developed at PUC-Campinas for the Computer Systems Organization course. It demonstrates fundamental concepts of low-level programming, including console I/O, loops, input validation, and basic arithmetic operations.

The purpose of this project is to document the initial steps in Assembly programming, illustrating fundamental techniques and problem-solving approaches in a resource-constrained environment.

Exercises Overview: Each .ASM file corresponds to a specific exercise, progressively introducing new Assembly concepts:

> ATIV3_1.asm: This program asks the user to type a single character on the keyboard. It then evaluates whether the character typed is a numeric digit (between '0' and '9'). If it is a number, the program displays the message "The character you typed is a number." Otherwise, it displays "The character you typed is not a number."

> ATIV03_2.asm: The program is a character classifier that operates in a continuous loop. It begins by requesting a character input from the user. After the user types and confirms, the program analyzes the character to determine its type.    
This cycle of requesting, reading, and classifying the character repeats continuously. The program only ends when the user decides to exit, which occurs by pressing the ESC key. When the key is detected, a farewell message ("End of program.") is displayed, and the program finishes its execution.
